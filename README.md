该脚本是实验性的，使用二分法查找进行sql盲注，也支持爆破ascii字符，时间盲注(需要条件为true时时间延迟)。你需要自定义payload，查看examples，爆破点(brute force point)标记为{BFP}，操作符(operator)标记为{OPE}，增长数字标记为{INC_5}(从5开始增长)，堆叠点标记为{STP}。增长数字和堆叠点用途示例：'user{STP}'=(select left(table_name,{INC_5}) from information_schema.tables where table_name like 'user%' limit 1)，表示从第5个字符爆破，爆破的字符会堆叠到{STP}进行下一次爆破。

This script is experimental and utilizes binary search for SQL blind injection. It also supports brute-forcing ASCII characters and time-based blind injection (with a delay when the condition is true). You need to customize the payload by referring to the examples provided. The brute force point is marked as {BFP}, the operator as {OPE}, increasing numbers as {INC_5} (starting from 5), and the stacking point as {STP}. Examples of the use of increasing numbers and stacking points: 'user{STP}'=(select left(table_name,{INC_5}) from information_schema.tables where table_name like 'user%' limit 1), indicating brute force starting from the 5th character, and the brute-forced characters will stack at {STP} for the next iteration.
